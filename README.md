# OpenMMLab Tutorial Series

This repository contains a series of tutorials on using various OpenMMLab repositories for computer vision tasks. We'll explore different components of the OpenMMLab ecosystem step by step.

## Tutorial Structure

1. **MMEngine** - The foundational library
   - Understanding the basic components
   - Building custom models using MMEngine template
   - Working with registries and runners

2. **MMDetection** - Object Detection Framework
   - Setting up MMDetection
   - Training on custom datasets
   - Inference and deployment
   - Fine-tuning pre-trained models

3. **MMSegmentation** (Coming Soon)
   - Semantic segmentation basics
   - Training segmentation models
   - Custom dataset preparation

4. **MMTracking** (Coming Soon)
   - Object tracking fundamentals
   - Multiple object tracking
   - Integration with detection models

5. **Additional OpenMMLab Projects** (Planned)
   - MMPose
   - MMRotate
   - MMYolo
   - And more...

## Getting Started

The tutorials are designed to be followed sequentially, as later sections may build upon concepts introduced earlier. Each section will include:

- Theoretical background
- Practical examples
- Code implementations
- Best practices and tips

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of deep learning concepts
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
- Docker (optional but recommended)

## Setup

Check the Dockerfile in this repository for the recommended environment setup. It includes all necessary dependencies for running the tutorials.

Stay tuned as we continue to add more tutorials and examples!
